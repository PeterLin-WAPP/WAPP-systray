## Development Guidelines

### Animation Development
- Use CSS transitions with cubic-bezier easing for natural motion
- Maintain the 5-stage loading sequence timing
- Test animations across different window sizes
- Ensure no visual artifacts or morphing during transitions

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React functional component patterns
- Use meaningful variable names for animation states
- Comment complex animation timing logic

### File Organization
- Keep animations in `styles.css` with clear section comments
- Use React state management for loading stages
- Organize assets by their usage in the sequence

## Animation Guidelines

### Timing Standards
- Maintain the established 800ms interval pattern
- Use smooth transitions (300-400ms duration)
- Synchronize elements that appear together

### Visual Quality
- No stretching or morphing effects
- Smooth opacity transitions
- Proper z-index layering
- Responsive scaling (use vw units for proportional elements)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Animations run smoothly at 60fps
- [ ] No visual artifacts during transitions
- [ ] Proper timing alignment across all stages
- [ ] Responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during animations

## Reporting Issues
